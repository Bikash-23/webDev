# JavaScript and classes

## OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm built around the concept of "objects," 
which encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
It allows developers to model real-world entities,
making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- Ex -> toLowerCase,toUpperCase,Promise

## why use OOP
- Code Reusability
- Better Organization
- Easy Maintenance
- Data Security(Encapsulation)
- Modularity(east to test and debug)
- Scalability
- Real- world Modeling

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constuction function
- Prototype
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars
Abstuction (hide internal details)
Encapsulation (wrap up data)
Inheritance (superclass/parent acquires the property and behavior of subclass)
Polymorphism (many form)
